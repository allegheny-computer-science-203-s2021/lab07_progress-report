## Summary

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this
repository contains the starter for Laboratory 7, corresponding to progress report of a Software Project 2, in Computer Science 203. As
part of this assignment, you should answer all of the questions in the
`report.md` file, furnishing evidence of your contributions towards completing the long-term software engineering project. Students
who have questions about this task should talk with a student technical leader
or the course instructor.

## Code of Conduct

Throughout the completion of this software engineering project you must adhere
to the code of conduct that we developed as part of a previous laboratory
assignment.
In addition to reporting any violations of the code of conduct,
please make sure that you attest to the fact that you followed the code of
conduct. That is, make sure you have signed the Code of Conduct document in its repository. Students who think that the software engineering team should revise
some aspect of the code of conduct must use the GitHub issue tracker for that
repository to suggest, discuss, and implement any required changes.

## Technical and Professional Skills

Even though this long-term software engineering project involves a multiple-week
effort, you are expected to make significant contributions to the project every
week. As a means for documenting your contributions to this project, you should
fully complete the progress report document and, additionally, annotate the
assessment guide to track your proficiency of the professional and technical skills
in the field of software engineering. For this task, please copy the `assessment.md` file from your
previous lab report repository. Then, for each category for which you decide an
assessment is appropriate, you should write a couple of sentences reporting
your current level of proficiency and the evidence that you would furnish to support
your assessment. If there is not a description next to one of the assessment
criteria, then the instructor will assume that you are currently working at the
:flushed: level. Please note that you are responsible for documenting your
proficiency of all the technical and professional skills in software engineering by
the completion of this long-term software project.

## Assignment Assessment

The grade that a student receives on this assignment will have the following
components.

- **GitHub Actions CI Build Status [up  to 10%]:**: For lab07 repository associated with this assignment students will receive a checkmark grade if their last before-the-deadline build passes.

- **Mastery of Technical Writing [up  to 25%]:**: Students will also receive a checkmark grade
  when the responses to the  writing questions presented in the
  `report.md` reveal a proficiency of both writing skills and technical
  knowledge. To receive a checkmark grade, the submitted writing should have
  correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in addition to following the rules
  of Markdown and providing  accurate answers.

- **Personal Assessment [up  to 15%]:**: Students will also receive a checkmark grade
  when their personal assessment is appropriately documents in the `assessment.md` file.

- **Level of Contribution [up  to 30%]:**: Students will also receive a checkmark grade
  when their level of contribution indicates active engagement in the process of planning and implementation to the software engineering project. The engagement should be reported in the
  progress report document located in this repository.

- **Mastery of Technical Knowledge and Skills [up  to 20%]**: Students will also receive a
  checkmark grade when their contributions reveal that they have improved on
  the technical knowledge and skills developed during the completion of
  this assignment. As a part of this grade, the instructor will assess aspects
  of the project 2 including, but not limited to, the completion of assigned tasks, the use of effective GitHub issues, use of the project board, correct use of GitHub flow practices, and contributions made to the software project.

All grades for this project will be reported through a student's gradebook GitHub
repository.

## Receiving Assistance

If you are having trouble completing any part of this project, then please talk
with either the course instructor or a student technical leader during the
lab session. Alternatively, you may ask questions in the Slack workspace for
this course. Finally, you can schedule a meeting during the course instructor's
office hours.
